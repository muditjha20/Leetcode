/*

Understand - We are finding the max no. of pairs that add up to k.
Match - hashmap

Plan - 
1. Loop through each element with an index i. Set operations = 0
2. if an element is found in the hashmap that adds up to k with the current element, increment operations by 1. 
3. If not, push that into the hashmap or increment its value by 1.
4. Return operations.

Runtime = O(n)
